# Beetle_KaiXin_SexualSizeDimorphism

Hi welcome!

1. You can find codes for my box plot here. I'm using this box plot to illustrate the comparison of female and male body size to determine SSD in O. cf. babirussa across Malaysian (MY) populations: Langkawi, Central Peninsula MY and Singapore(SG) population: Pulau Ubin and CCNR.
The file is named "boxplot_SSD.R"

2. You can find codes for Kruskal-Wallis test. I'm using this test because Body Size is a continuous variable and my other variables (sex,population,country) are categorical = ANOVA BUT my data is not normal --> therefore, the non-parametric test equivalent is Kruskal wallis. http://blog.minitab.com/blog/understanding-statistics/data-not-normal-try-letting-it-be-with-a-nonparametric-hypothesis-test
